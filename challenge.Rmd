Create a personal R package for your own use. This type of package is great for functions and templates that you find yourself using over and over. 

1. Create the package: `create_package()`

A common theme for these packages is the person's initials and something about what it does, e.g. `Hmisc` and `cowplot`. (Those two personal packages ended up being quite a bit more popular than just the one original user!)

2. Add some functions: `use_r()`. 

Think about code you find yourself typing repeatedly. If you can't think of anything, a good place to start is a simple ggplot2 theme. 

3. Run `check()`

Fix anything that comes up, like using `use_mit_license()` to fix a missing LICENSE file.

4. Add roxygen and document your function with `use_roxygen_md()` and `document()`

Document your functions!

5. Add tests with `use_test()`

Remember, focus on external aspects of you code. 

6. Add a README: `use_readme_rmd()`

Describe the package and who it's for (you!)

7. Add git and send your package to GitHub, or a similar service, with `use_git()` and `use_github()`.

8. Keep adding things as you think of them! Write, document, build, test, and check often!
